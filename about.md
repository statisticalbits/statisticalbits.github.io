I’m passionate about data, technology, and decision-making, and this blog is a space to explore statistics, AI, machine learning, and product management—breaking down complex ideas into practical insights.

With experience in building products, leading teams, and working with data-driven systems, I’ve seen how analytics, automation, and structured thinking influence decision-making across industries. My background includes both real-world applications in Autonomous vehicles and academic exploration at Stanford, where I’ve deepened my understanding of AI, statistics, and business strategy.

This blog is for anyone who enjoys exploring AI trends, understanding statistical concepts, or thinking about how products are built and optimized.
