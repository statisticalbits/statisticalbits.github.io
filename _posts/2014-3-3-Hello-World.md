Why This Blog?
I’ve enjoy the process of uncovering the hidden simple truths behind complicated topics and buzzwords - especially in Statistics and AI.

What to Expect
This blog is where I’ll explore statistics, AI, probability, and mathematical reasoning—starting from first principles and building up to deeper insights. My goal is to simplify without oversimplifying, to make concepts clear but not shallow, and to highlight the beauty in how things truly work.

Who’s This For?
If you find joy in seeing through complexity, understanding the "why" behind concepts, and breaking big ideas into simple truths, this blog is for you.

Looking forward to exploring these ideas together!
