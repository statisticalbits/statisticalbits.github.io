## Why This Blog?
I’ve enjoy the process of uncovering the hidden simple truths behind complicated topics and buzzwords - especially in the fast growing field of AI. I find it hard to catch up with the jargon and its so easy to get lost in the myriads of concepts which seem so different but at the same time similar. When you dig deeper (beyond the jargon) you will often realize that the concepts are nothing but Statistics and probability theory repackaged into some fancy jargon. 

## What to Expect?
This blog is where I’ll explore **statistics, AI, probability, and mathematical reasoning** starting from first principles and building up to deeper insights. My goal is to simplify without oversimplifying, to make concepts clear but not shallow, and to highlight the beauty in how things truly work.

## Who’s This For?
If you find joy in seeing through complexity, understanding the "why" behind concepts, and breaking big ideas into simple truths, this blog is for you.

Looking forward to exploring these ideas together!
